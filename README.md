zsh prompt origionally implemented by https://github.com/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt

I no longer install the haskell toolchain everywhere so am trying to implement that prompt in Rust.


## Installation

Install `zsh-git-prompt-rs` via `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install zsh-git-prompt-rs
```

in your zsh init

```zsh
source <THIS_REPO>/scripts/zshrc.sh
```

# TODO

* Seems correct but real merge conflicts still need to be tested
